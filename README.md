This repository contains the dataset and the output used for our Bachelor Thesis:  
**"Benchmarking Large Language Models in UML Diagram Generation from Informal Notations."**

## Repository Structure

- **`informal_diagrams/`**  
  Contains the original informal diagrams extracted from academic papers. These were used as input for all tested language models.

- **`generated_diagrams/`**  
  Contains UML diagrams generated by four multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs):
  - ChatGPT 4o (OpenAI)
  - Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic)
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google)
  - Llama 4 Maverick (Meta)

  Each file was generated from an informal diagram using a unified prompting approach and validated for PlantUML syntax.

- **`error_outputs/`**  
  Contains any failed or invalid output files that did not pass the PlantUML syntax validation step. These are useful for analyzing failure cases in UML generation.

## Purpose

This dataset supports our evaluation of:
- Syntactic correctness of UML outputs
- Semantic alignment with the original informal input
- Model performance variation across five UML diagram types (Class, Activity, Use Case, State Machine, Sequence)
